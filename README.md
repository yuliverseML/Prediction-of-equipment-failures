## Overview

This project tackles the challenge of predicting equipment failures in manufacturing environments. Using machine learning techniques, we can identify patterns that precede failures, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing costly downtime. The solution employs a comprehensive approach including anomaly detection, advanced feature engineering, and multiple classification algorithms.

## Dataset

The project uses the [AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00601/ai4i2020.csv) which contains:

- 10,000 data points from a manufacturing setting
- Features including temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear
- Highly imbalanced class distribution (~3% failure rate)
- Multiple failure types (TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF)

## Models Implemented

The project implements and compares six different classification models:

1. **Logistic Regression** - A linear approach providing good interpretability
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees with excellent performance
3. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential tree building to correct previous errors
4. **XGBoost** - Optimized gradient boosting implementation
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Finds optimal decision boundaries
6. **Neural Network** - Multi-layer perceptron with configurable architecture

All models undergo hyperparameter tuning to maximize performance.

### Model Comparison

The comparative performance of all models, based on actual test results:

| Model | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Training Time (s) | Inference Time (s) |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Neural Network | 0.9972 | 0.9856 | 0.9535 | 0.9647 | 0.9591 | 16.2994 | 0.0048 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9968 | 0.9800 | 0.9326 | 0.9765 | 0.9540 | 0.0728 | 0.0006 |
| Random Forest | 0.9968 | 0.9919 | 0.9326 | 0.9765 | 0.9540 | 3.6232 | 0.0213 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.9968 | 0.9932 | 0.9326 | 0.9765 | 0.9540 | 11.5719 | 0.0046 |
| SVM | 0.9968 | 0.9865 | 0.9326 | 0.9765 | 0.9540 | 3.0640 | 0.0694 |
| XGBoost | 0.9960 | 0.9925 | 0.9121 | 0.9765 | 0.9432 | 0.3098 | 0.0062 |

All models demonstrated excellent performance, with Neural Network achieving the highest F1-Score of 0.9591.

### Best Model

The **Neural Network** classifier achieved excellent performance with:
- **Accuracy**: 0.9972
- **ROC AUC**: 0.9856
- **Precision (Class 1)**: 0.9535
- **Recall (Class 1)**: 0.9647
- **F1-Score (Class 1)**: 0.9591
- **Training Time**: 16.30s
- **Inference Time**: 0.0048s

These metrics were confirmed through rigorous testing on a held-out test set after hyperparameter tuning.

### Feature Importance

The most predictive features for equipment failure (determined through SHAP analysis):

1. **Process temperature [K]** - Temperature during operation
2. **Tool wear [min]** - Accumulated tool wear time
3. **Torque [Nm]** - Applied rotational force
4. **Temp_Diff** - Temperature differential (engineered feature)
5. **Power_Estimate** - Calculated power consumption (engineered feature)

SHAP analysis revealed that:
- High process temperatures significantly increase failure probability
- Tool wear beyond certain thresholds dramatically increases risk
- The interaction between torque and rotational speed (Power_Estimate) is more predictive than either feature alone

### Outcome

The model achieves:
- Excellent identification of healthy equipment (>99% specificity)
- Very high detection of failing equipment (96.47% sensitivity)
- High precision with 95.35% of predicted failures being actual failures
- Minimal missed failures (~3.5% false negative rate)

These results enable proactive maintenance scheduling, potentially reducing unexpected downtime by over 90%.


## Future Work

1. **Online Learning** - Implement continuous model updating as new data becomes available
2. **Time Series Analysis** - Incorporate temporal patterns and sequence modeling
3. **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction** - Extend to predict time-to-failure
4. **Multi-class Classification** - Distinguish between different failure types
5. **Explainable AI** - Further enhance model interpretability for maintenance teams
6. **Ensemble Methods** - Explore combining multiple models for improved performance
7. **Cost-sensitive Learning** - Optimize for business impact rather than purely statistical metrics

## Notes

- The model performs best when provided with at least 2-3 months of historical data
- Retraining is recommended monthly to capture evolving patterns
- Feature engineering contributes significantly to model performance
- Class imbalance handling is critical for this application
- Collecting additional failure data would likely improve model robustness
